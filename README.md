# aoc2015

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2015 (https://adventofcode.com/2015/about), done long after the fact just for fun and practice.

I elected to do these problems using everybody's favourite programming language, JavaScript.

The usual AOC stuff applies - concise solutions are preferred over readable code (up to a point). Variable names are generally short and sometimes non-descriptive where context should make their function clear.
